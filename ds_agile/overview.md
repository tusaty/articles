# 1. Inroduction
 - Problem with current approach
 - Why iterative approach
 - Typical fails
    - Einstellung
    - Non-value driven
    - No interaction with end users
    - Following non-valid plan
    - Hard limits not defined
    - Not iterative
    - Motivation loss
    - Excuse for ad-hoc behaviour

# 2. Putting new candidate tasks in the backlog
  - Core stories (stretch)
  - Atomic tasks
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Acceptance criteria trick: define next steps
  - Lazy approach: details and tasks are added as story is selected by OM
  - Dividing activities onto "products" and "processes"
  - Background processes: education; research / experimentation


# 3. Planning with the team
  - Think more about processes
  - Define limited number of products for each sprint
  - Two weeks chunking


# 4. Daily routines: going through the work
  - Status: lead to keep-in sync with each team-member
  - Lead makes leads: grow leads in your team
  - Automate everything
  - Task assignee is accountable for QA
  -


# 5. Retrospectives
  - Provide visibility to upper management
  - Legitimate the work being done and next steps
  - Get feedback from broader team
  - Share knowledge / experience with juniors
  - How to handle non-demoable work?
  - Make team members feel accountability for work being done
  - Peer-teams review
